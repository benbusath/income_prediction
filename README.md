# Income Predicion
In this Jupyter Notebook, I create and optimize an ensemble model utilizing sklearn pipelines that predicts whether a person will make more than $50k a year.

The end-to-end process is as follows:
1. Conduct EDA of the dataset, remove redundant features
2. Create format data and create sklearn pipelines to help format data for modeling
3. Create the models and run initial cross-validation testing
4. Tune hyper-parameters of all of our models
5. Create ensemble estimator and compare with individual estimators.
